# Intruder Detection System with PMAC0 Cryptographic Protocol

This repository contains an Intruder Detection System (IDS) that utilizes the PMAC0 cryptographic protocol, implemented using C-MPI.

## Overview

The Intruder Detection System is designed to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts in a network. It leverages the PMAC0 cryptographic protocol for secure communication and data integrity verification. The implementation is based on C-MPI for efficient parallel processing.

## Features

- **PMAC0 Cryptographic Protocol**: Ensures secure communication and data integrity.
- **C-MPI Implementation**: Utilizes parallel processing for efficient performance.
- **Intruder Detection**: Detects and responds to unauthorized access attempts in real-time.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Logs intrusion attempts and generates reports for analysis.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rasib0/idps.git
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Intruder Detection System via the python script.
2. Monitor the system for unauthorized access attempts.
3. Respond to intrusions as necessary.
4. Review logs and reports for analysis.
